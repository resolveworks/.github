We build systems that work with people, not replace them. We make complexity look simple.

### What we do

We help ethical projects leverage modern technology to create practical tools that amplify what teams already do well.

### How we think

Tech should be a tool, not a replacement. We build systems that respect the humans using them. Transparency matters. Process matters. And often the best solution is the boring one that just works.
